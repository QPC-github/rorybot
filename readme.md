# Rory: Catch content style guide violations

Rory finds style errors by comparing input text against a set of incorrect terms in the [retext-styleguide](https://github.com/Shopify/retext-styleguide) repo. Rory explains why your word choices are incorrect according to the Shopify [content](https://styleguide.myshopify.com/content/) and [documentation](https://vault.shopify.com/Documentation/Documentation-Style-Guide) style guides (for example, "avoid anthropomorphism"), and suggests alternatives.

You can run rory from the command line, or install a [plugin](https://github.com/Shopify/linter-rory) for the text editor [Atom](https://atom.io/) that checks your text as you type.

## Installing

Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, then run:

```sh
$ sudo npm install --global git+ssh://git@github.com:Shopify/rory
```

That will install rory, as well as installing retext-styleguide as a module within rory.

## Using the Atom linter

Install rory, then see the readme for [linter-rory](https://github.com/Shopify/linter-rory).

## Using the command line

Say `example.md` contains the following text:

```md
Login to the Shopify Manual to customise colours in the Shopify point of sale application. 
```

Run **rory** on `example.md`:

```sh
$ rory example.md
```

This yields:

```txt
example.md
    1:1-1:6  warning  `Login to` violates Shopify style: 'login is a noun, not a verb.' Use `Log into`.              login-to
  1:14-1:21  warning  `Shopify Manual` violates Shopify style: 'incorrect branded name.' Use `Shopify Help Center`.  help-centre
  1:32-1:41  warning  `customise` violates Shopify style: 'write with American spelling.' Use `customize`.           customise
  1:57-1:64  warning  `Shopify point of sale` violates Shopify style: 'incorrect branded name.' Use `Shopify POS`.   Shopify-point of sale

When no input files are given to rory, it searches for markdown and text files in the current directory.

If you want to search all Ruby files within your current directory, run:

```sh
$ rory *.rb
```
If you want to write the results to a file, use the `tee` command.

```sh
$ rory *.rb | tee output.txt
```

If you want to check a string within your terminal:

```sh
$ echo "Login to the Shopify Manual to customise colours in the Shopify point of sale application." | rory
```

Run `$ rory --help` for more information. You can also check out Titus Wormer's [original alex.js application](https://github.com/wooorm/alex) for info about the API, which we haven't looked into yet.
